I am a computer engineering student at CSUF and I expect to graduate in 2027-28.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs
* Lab 5, part 2

  In this lab we had to code a program that calculated decimal feet to feet and inches. I enjoyed this lab because of the use of our mathematical skills. We used a lot of double for our code.

* Lab 6, part 2

  In this lab, we had to code a program of blackjack. I really enjoyed working on this lab because I never really knew how to play blackjack before. While learning how to set up the code for
  this assignment, I enjoyed learning about how the game of blackjack works.

* Lab 9, part 1

  In this lab, we had to code a program about judging what number is the average within a list. I enjoyed working on this assignment because of the use of a for loop. I also didn't really think
  of coding something that would calculate the average of a list of numbers so it definitely was a first.
